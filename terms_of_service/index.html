                    and
                    the
                    surrounding areas.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Cleaning Services</h4>
                        <p>We agree to perform the cleaning services as detailed in your specific service quotation.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <p><b>Access:</b> The client must ensure that BOCH personnel have safe, unhindered access to
                                the
                                property and necessary utilities (water and electricity) for the duration of the
                                service.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Breakages/Damages:</b> While we exercise extreme care, the Client must secure or
                                remove
                                fragile, valuable, or irreplaceable items prior to the service. BOCH is not liable for
                                damages
                                resulting from normal wear and tear or items not explicitly secured.</p>

                        <h4>Fumigation & Pest Control Services</h4>
                        <p>We agree to perform pest control using methods and chemicals compliant with Ugandan law and
                            industry
                            best practice.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <p><b>Preparation:</b> The Client must follow all pre-treatment instructions (e.g., removing
                                food
                                items, emptying cabinets, leaving the premises) provided by BOCH. Failure to comply may
                                compromise the effectiveness of the treatment and void any guarantee.</p>
                            <p><b>Re-entry:</b> The Client must not re-enter the premises until the time specified by
                                the
                                BOCH

                            <p><b>Guarantees:</b> BOCH provides specific guarantees (e.g., 30-day pest-free) only for
                                full,
                                recommended treatment plans, as clearly stated on your quote. Guarantees are void if the
                                Client
                                interferes with the treatment area or fails to address underlying structural issues
                                (e.g.,
                                leaky
                                pipes, structural damage, open entry points).</p>

                                size, or scope of the property significantly differs from the original description
                                (e.g.,
                                heavier infestation, excessive grime, or larger square footage). Any price adjustment
                                will
