            Cleaning</b>
        ("BOCH," "we," "us," or "our") and you, the client ("Client," "you," or "your"), governing your use of our
        services
        and website.</p>
    <p>By booking or using any service provided by BOCH, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
    <ol>
        <li class="services-scope">
            <h3>Scope of Services</h3>
            <p>BOCH provides professional Deep Cleaning and Certified Fumigation & Pest Control services in Uganda, and
                the
                surrounding areas.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Cleaning Services</h4>
                    <p>We agree to perform the cleaning services as detailed in your specific service quotation.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p><b>Access:</b> The client must ensure that BOCH personnel have safe, unhindered access to the
                            property and necessary utilities (water and electricity) for the duration of the service.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Breakages/Damages:</b> While we exercise extreme care, the Client must secure or remove
                            fragile, valuable, or irreplaceable items prior to the service. BOCH is not liable for
                            damages
                            resulting from normal wear and tear or items not explicitly secured.</p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Fumigation & Pest Control Services</h4>
                    <p>We agree to perform pest control using methods and chemicals compliant with Ugandan law and
                        industry
                        best practice.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p><b>Preparation:</b> The Client must follow all pre-treatment instructions (e.g., removing
                            food
                            items, emptying cabinets, leaving the premises) provided by BOCH. Failure to comply may
                            compromise the effectiveness of the treatment and void any guarantee.</p>
                        <p><b>Re-entry:</b> The Client must not re-enter the premises until the time specified by the
                            BOCH
                            technician for safety clearance.</p>
                        <p><b>Guarantees:</b> BOCH provides specific guarantees (e.g., 30-day pest-free) only for full,
                            recommended treatment plans, as clearly stated on your quote. Guarantees are void if the
                            Client
                            interferes with the treatment area or fails to address underlying structural issues (e.g.,
                            leaky
                            pipes, structural damage, open entry points).</p>

                            size, or scope of the property significantly differs from the original description (e.g.,
