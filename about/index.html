    <h1>About BOCH:</h1>
    <h3>The Standard for Clean and Pest-Free Surroundings</h3>
    <h2>Our Story:</h2>
    <h4>Built on Trust, Quality Service Delivery</h4>
    <p><b>BOCH</b> Fumigation and Cleaning was founded 10 years ago with a simple, powerful </p>
    <p><b>mission: </b>to redefine cleanliness and safety for homes and businesses across the region. We saw a need for
        a
        professional service that didn't just clean surfaces, but secured the environment from unwelcome pests and
        harmful
        germs.</p>
    <p>For years, we've been the trusted service providers, combining the deep-cleaning expertise of a professional
        service
        with the critical health protection of certified fumigation. We understand the specific challenges of the
        Ugandan
        climate and ecosystem, allowing us to deliver solutions that are highly effective, safe for your family, and
        compliant with all local regulations.</p>
    <h3>What We Do: The BOCH Dual-Advantage</h3>
    <p>Most companies offer cleaning or fumigation. BOCH offers both—a complete environment reset—ensuring your space is
        not
        just visibly clean, but fundamentally healthy and secure.</p>
